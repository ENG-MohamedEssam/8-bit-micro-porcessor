# 8-bit-micro-porcessor

## **Abstract**
### This project was the final project in the 1st year in Electrical Department
### The project was about replicating the functionality of the 8086 processor Architecture and implmenting it using Logic gates and ICs
### The processor Made many Arithmetic operations such as (Addition - Subtraction - Multiplication - Division - Factorial)
### The following image will give you a hint of the hardware connections
